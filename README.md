## Criteria


- When I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
- When I enter schema and seed commands then a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
- When I enter the command to invoke the application then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
- When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
- When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
